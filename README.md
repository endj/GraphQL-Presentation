### GraphQL project used to demostrate some features of the specification.

Wrote this project to demonstrate some features of GraphQL "interactively" by typing the queries and having the effects apply in real time. 
Never ended up using this for any actual presentation.

* Front-end components written in React, using Apollo Graphql client for queries.
* Back-end written in Spring MVC.
